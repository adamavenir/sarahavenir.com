              Nice to meet you! I'm a writer and maker-of-weird-Internet-projects. I love books and food and plants and theater and I'm fascinated by the beauty and terror of being alive on this planet. I make a living as co-founder and chief of staff at a web3 startup, and I do some coaching and consulting on organizational alignment & leadership from time to time. That's all I'll say about that here; you can{" "}

              This place is for friends and people who <em>would</em> be friends if we ever got the chance to meet. I invented a celebratory day called {" "}
              <a href="https://itspostday.com">Post Day</a> that happens from time to time. Anyone can celebrate! I have a <Link to="/newsletter">mailing list</Link>, where I share the occasional essay and updates about new things I'm making/trying. If you're interested in digital gardening, I share what I'm reading in my public{" "}

              If you like reading about thoughtful business topics, you can read my first book,{" "}
              <a href="https://gatherthepeople.com">Gather the People</a>,
              originally released in 2015 and updated in 2020. It was the book I needed as a bootstrapping business owner with the heart of an artist/hermit, and if that's you, I hope it helps.
