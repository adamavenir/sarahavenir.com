            <p>
              Having spent the major part of the last two decades building weird businesses that
              tried to be good for people, I'm a bit done talking about that topic. I still wear my business hat daily, but I don't care to write about it, at least not often. I'd rather write about secret impossible things. Also things that are true. 
            </p>

              I'm now working privately on a few experimental projects, one of which I'll be sharing in my <Link to="/newsletter">newsletter</Link> very soon. (Also, that newsletter? It only goes out when there's news. Sometimes there's no news for months.) If you're interested in digital gardening, I share what I'm learning in my public{" "}
              <a href="http://roam.sarahavenir.com">Roam</a>. It may not make sense to anyone but me, but you can at least see what I'm reading and the passages that are speaking to me as I read them. You can say
              hi on <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahavenir">Twitter</a> (I'm still quietly there, for some reason) or by{" "}

              If you like reading about thoughtful business topics, you can read my first book,{" "}
              <a href="https://gatherthepeople.com">Gather the People</a>,
              originally released in 2015 and updated in 2020. It was the book I needed as a bootstrapping business owner with the heart of an artist/hermit, and if that's you, I hope it helps.

              I may not be very loud on the Internet anymore, but I'm still here, taking this thing one step at a time. I do not know how to categorize what it is that I'm doing here, but I like Mary Ruefle's description of the member of the band who hits the triangle from time to time. I probably should find my own description, but I will gratefully point her way in the meantime.
