              Nice to meet you! I'm a writer, reader, and aspiring hermit. I love books and food and plants and theater and I'm fascinated by the beauty and terror of being alive on this planet.
            </p>
            <p>In my past life, I was a founder at various times and a CEO at various times, and I now make a living as co-founder and chief of staff at a web3 startup. I do some coaching and consulting on organizational alignment & leadership occasionally (if that's something you need, you can {" "}
             <a href="mailto:sarahavenir@hey.com">email me</a>; I have loads of empathy for anyone trying to make a business work).
            </p>
            <p>
              I invented a celebratory day called {" "}
              <a href="https://itspostday.com">Post Day</a> that happens from time to time. Anyone can celebrate! {" "}
              <a href="https://lovenotetoabook.substack.com">I also write letters to books I have loved</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a <Link to="/newsletter">mailing list</Link>, where I share the occasional update about new things I'm making/trying. If you're interested in digital gardening, I share what I'm reading in my public{" "}

            <p>
              If you like reading about thoughtful business topics, you can read my first book,{" "}
              <a href="https://gatherthepeople.com">Gather the People</a>,
              originally released in 2015 and updated in 2020. It was the book I needed as a bootstrapping business owner with the heart of an artist, and if that's you, I hope it helps.
