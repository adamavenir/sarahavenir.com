            <p>
              I‚Äôm a student and teacher of people-first growth. Having spent the
              major part of the last two decades building weird businesses that
              tried to be good for humans, I'm now working privately on a few
              experimental projects and cultivating this little digital space of
              mine.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're new here, I'm working on my second book,{" "}
              <a href="http://peoplefirstgrowth.com">People-First Growth</a>{" "}
              (slowly, slowly said the sloth), and I‚Äôm sharing what I learn in
              my <Link to="/newsletter">newsletter</Link>. If you geek out on
              digital gardening, I share mine publicly on{" "}
              <a href="http://roam.sarahavenir.com">Roam</a>. You can say
              hi on <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahavenir">Twitter</a> or by{" "}
              <a href="mailto:sarahavenir@hey.com">email</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also read my first book,{" "}
              <a href="https://gatherthepeople.com">Gather the People</a>,
              originally released in 2015 and updated in 2020 (what a year for a
              book release). It's a human approach to marketing for people who
              would rather make what they love than persuade people to buy it.
              If that's you, I hope it helps.
