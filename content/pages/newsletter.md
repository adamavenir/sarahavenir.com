title: This newsletter is for friends
slug: newsletter
---

I don't mean that in the "we're all friends here" sense, necessarily. Although if you're here, we probably are (or we are friends of friends, which in my mind is the same thing). But if you're looking for a newsletter that is about topics relevant to your interests, this probably isn't that.

I send out this newsletter from time to time, whenever I have something worth saying or I've made something worth sharing. Every time I send it, I have trouble getting back to my preferred serenity for a day or two, so I try to share thoughtfully, if infrequently. It is worth the sending though. It is wonderful when the things that make me come alive connect me in some small way to you.
