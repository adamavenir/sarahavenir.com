Hello! I’m Sarah. You might know me as the author of [Gather the People](https://gatherthepeople.com) or as the CEO of [&yet](https://andyet.com), a digital agency focused on approaching business growth in ways that put people first. (But if you don't know me, you're in good company! I'm kind of a hermit who lives in my reading cave, popping out every now and again to let people know I'm still alive.)

I'm working on my next book, [People-First Growth](http://peoplefirstgrowth.com), and this newsletter is where I share the resources I'm discovering and thinks I'm thinking along the way.

If you geek out on people-first growth stuff, you can follow along daily at [roam.sarahavenir.com](http://roam.sarahavenir.com). AND if you're into reading books as they're being written, head over to [peoplefirstgrowth.com](http://peoplefirstgrowth.com). But don't worry! If that's all too much, I'll make sure to keep you posted in the newsletter.

Looking forward to sharing with you!

<3, Sarah
