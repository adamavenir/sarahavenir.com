> Last week was my first week as CEO of &yet. ([Adam wrote a post about it](https://blog.andyet.com/2019/07/02/role-transitions/), if you havent heard yet.)
> 
> It was a pretty natural transition, but still I have so many feelings about it—excited about new possibility, nervous about the responsibility, grateful for our supportive team, determined to see us get some short- and long-term wins, curious about all I’ve got to learn. I could write a book about all the feelings.

> Instead, I'm going to start writing letters. To our team, to you, to people who subscribe to my personal newsletter. I want to talk openly about some of the challenges we face in being a remote, internet-based, people-first company, because I bet they’re challenges a lot of us have in common. (In fact, I know they are; I've talked to a dozen tech company leaders in the past month as research for [Gather the People](https://gatherthepeople.com/). None of us are alone, no matter what hard thing we’re working through.)
