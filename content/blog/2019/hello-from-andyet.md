> The past two months have been a surreal experience. We added several folks to our team on the growth side (Hi, [Jessica](https://andyet.com/team/jessica)! Hi, [Lauren](https://andyet.com/team/lauren)!), which meant creating new roles, new processes, and a new team structure. On the personal front, Adam and I went to Disneyland for a full week with our 5 kids and 2 co-parents. Adam’s grampa died, which was an incredible loss to the whole family (he was such an amazing man, and they were very close). 2 of our kids got the flu, and then I got the flu. My parents flew across the country to visit us for 2 weeks. Thanksgiving happened. One of our kids had a birthday the next day.
