> I’ve been thinking about the phrase “leap and the net will appear” this week. I’ve never felt so strongly that this is terrible advice (sorry John Burroughs…the Internet attributes this to you. It really sounds lovely though.) I’d be more likely to say “leap without a net and you might end up with a broken face, but that’s actually okay because you’ll learn something.”

> I’m more of a net-builder myself. I take big and small leaps all the time, but not without at least some version of a net underneath me. That net may or may not hold, but knowing it’s there helps me move confidently in the direction of something new.
