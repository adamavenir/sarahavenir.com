> Adam took me on my first backpacking trip a month ago, and my second last weekend. Since then, I keep thinking about how grounding it is to be in the woods. Your circle of concern is shrunk until it extends no farther outside of you than your arm. Everything you need is on your back and anything designed to fulfill more than those immediate needs doesn’t matter.
