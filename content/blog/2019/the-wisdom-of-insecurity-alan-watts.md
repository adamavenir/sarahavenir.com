> “For the greater part of human activity is designed to make permanent those experiences and joys which are only lovable because they are changing. Yet the moment you arrest the flow and prolong a note or chord beyond its time, the rhythm is destroyed. Because life is likewise a flowing process, change and death are its necessary parts. To work for their exclusion is to work against life.”
