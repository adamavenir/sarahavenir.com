> I’ve been thinking a lot lately about the type of presence Amy Cuddy refers to in her book. I’m solidly an introvert. If I had my way, I would spend 85% of my time in solitude or with my partner (who also likes solitude), 14% of my time one on one with people I feel kinship with, and 1% of my time meeting new people.  
>   
> And yet, my life is full of meeting new people. Every day I have at least one conversation in which I’m representing our company to someone I've never met (and trying to do it well).
