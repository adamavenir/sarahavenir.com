Since I took on the CEO role at &yet coming up on two years ago, I've been focused on developing systems for growth. Both &yet's growth, since I was taking us down a new path, and my own growth into the role I was about to take on.

Part of this was because I wanted to be intentional and do things differently than I had in my previous ventures. My natural inclination is to pour myself totally into some grand vision (and, if I'm being honest, to run hard and fast away from outcomes that I do not want). In hindsight, this is obviously a recipe for burnout, but it was what I was used to.

As anyone with similar histories knows, it isn't so much wisdom that convinces you to change your approach as much as your utter inability to make yourself do things anymore. If I could have kept going on in that way, I surely would have. It was working for me in every respect except the one that matters most.

The other reason healthy systems became so important to me was that I could see resemblances of my experience as a person in &yet's as a company. &yet has always been full of optimism and the tendency to go all in on a grand vision. While the company has consistently tried to prioritize the well-being of the individuals who work there, its own health has been through the wringer (which certainly impacts everyone). For as many victories as we have celebrated, we've had just as many downturns to recover from. Each time we've rallied together and come through somehow, but it hasn't been without its tolls.

This isn't a confession piece about burnout though, or the feast/famine paradox of agency life. It's more about what I've found along the path, and what a gift it has ultimately been to me. I've found a thoughtfulness within myself about how those of us who've been victims of our own optimism and ambition might learn, however awkwardly, to work differently. It isn't a solution I'm proposing, but rather a set of observations that might be useful (or simply validating) if any of this sounds resoundingly familiar.

This may end up being several pieces, because we've got some ground to cover. 

**First, I want to share my perspective on how a system designed for human beings is different from a system designed for minimal human input/error and maximum economic output.** There are several principles I think may be true, or at least part of the truth. (I hesitate to say "these are the only principles" because every day I learn something new that tends to deconstruct or show another side of things I've learned up to that point.)

**Second, I want to share some skills that have become necessary for me to develop within myself to create a strong foundation for these systems to be built upon.** These skills (and likely more) are necessary to counterbalance the very real vulnerabilities and emotional labor that is introduced when you build systems designed to acknowledge and allow for the wholeness of human experience.

**And finally, I want to share my current understanding of how to build an ever-evolving, forward moving human system**, using my personal systems and the systems we're building at &yet as an example. I'm a little embarrassed at how self-referential a lot of my thinking is, but as a highly reflective person, it's the best I have to give. I hope it's helpful to you.
