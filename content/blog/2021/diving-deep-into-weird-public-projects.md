[This is the issue](https://buttondown.email/sarahavenir/archive/1064cb3f-3237-40c1-8bb3-110b24ac7496) where I started writing my next book on [People-First Growth](https://peoplefirstgrowth.com) in public. 

I also answer the question, "Was there any particular resource or documentation that helped you figure out where to start building out your public Roam project?"

Enjoy :)
