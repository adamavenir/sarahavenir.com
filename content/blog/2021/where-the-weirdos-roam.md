I [wrote this piece](https://find.yourweirdos.com/posts/where-the-weirdos-roam) for our [Find Your Weirdos](https://find.yourweirdos.com) project at [&yet](https://andyet.com). 

> "It’s easy to create a “customer persona” or a “user journey” to inform your product, marketing, and sales decisions. It’s much more challenging to actually understand the person you’re doing all of this for. There are two ways that focusing on weirdos makes this much easier."

(The buffalo image is by my teammate Lynn Fisher, inspired by my [public Roam project](http://roam.sarahavenir.com). "Where the buffalos roam"...get it?)
