It's so great that as soon as I decide to experiment with "casual blogging", I write something called "Inverting our Relationship to Productivity." I don't know why I have friends.

[@ansate](https://twitter.com/ansate) tweeted something today that had me nodding along:

And then I tweeted something back:

I didn't say it in the Twitter thread, but I've been experimenting with this exact thing for the past four days. Yes, I have tasks I'm committed to for work and family and all of that, but whenever I've had "free time," instead of looking for something to do, I've tried just sitting there until I _really_ want to do something.

## Here's how the experiment has gone so far:

**Day one**: Sat quietly in thought for hours; didn't want to do anything in particular

**Day two**: Same as Day one; had the thought, "maybe I just don't like doing things"

**Day three** (this was last night): Mostly the same as Day one, but then at night I started feeling weepy. I actually got sad that I wasn't writing. I missed it. I missed having people to write for. I missed that feeling that I have a Thing to do that is an important part of me, and sometimes helpful to others.

**Day four**: Today I'm writing, and I'm so excited about writing. 

Now, this is interesting to me, because I expected that at some point I would get tired of doing nothing and get inspired or excited about doing something. Or at least get really bored and antsy. 

But what actually happened is that I started to feel feelings. Big feelings. Feelings that are quite nuanced, because I actually _have_ been writing. I'm working on [my next book](http://peoplefirstgrowth.com), I'm working on a [series of essays](https://sarahavenir.com/how-to-build-a-fractal-system-of-practice)...writing things are happening. If you're on my [newsletter](https://sarahavenir.com/newsletter), you may have noticed. 

The feelings I was feeling though were _actually_ about community. I used to write a lot, and I used to interact with other people through my writing. Blogging was a form of community for me. It was about identity, sure, but it was more than that...it was a way for this introvert to be seen and appreciated for who I am on the inside.

So today I decided to try blogging again. I'm not committing to it in perpetuity. The only thing I'm actually committed to is doing nothing until I really want to do something. But maybe it will keep leading me down this path.

In the [Tend](https://www.maraglatzel.com/tend/) program I'm in, [Mara Glatzel](https://www.instagram.com/maraglatzel/) talks a lot about getting in "right relationship" to different things in our lives. I feel like I've been in "wrong relationship" with productivity for a long, long time. It's a carrot/stick, proceed-with-caution-or-I-might-break-my-ability-to-do-things relationship that I've tried many different ways of healing.

But I haven't tried inverting it until this week. It's interesting. Maybe I'll try the sleep thing next.
