> “People say that what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life. I don’t think that’s what we’re really seeking. I think what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive.
> 
> The mind has to do with meaning. But what’s the meaning of a flower? What’s the meaning of the universe? What’s the meaning of a flea? We are so focused on doing things to achieve purposes of outer value that we forget that the inner value—the rapture that is associated with being alive—is what it’s all about.
> 
> The ultimate mystery of being is beyond all categories of thought. My friend Heinrich Zimmer years ago used to say, ‘The best things can’t be told.’”
> 
> —Joseph Campbell, The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers
